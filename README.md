# MyPortfolio
This is my first portfolio website developed. It was pretty easy after getting the hang of it. Not the best , but learned a lot in the process. Meets most of the acceptance criteria.
It was a bit challenging but taking it piece by piece works out. I know that one day in the future I will probably look back at this and laugh at myself. LOL
This is not a finsihed product. It will get a whole lot better as my skills develop while developing.
